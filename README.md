# Battlegrounds Historian

**WoW TBC classic addon for battlegrounds history and statistics**

Working TBC Fork of [ZergRael's BGHistorian](https://github.com/ZergRael/BGHistorian) updated for TBC Classic.

BG Historian tries to record every battleground joined and compiles statistics.
Heavily inspired by [Reflex](https://curseforge.com/wow/addons/reflex-battleground-historian), which has been confirmed to focus only on retail version.

Responds a minimap button.

## Features

The main goal is to analyze global, average and individual performances on a set of battlegrounds.

Mostly working parts :

- Record played battlegrounds statistics
- Display summarised battlegrounds history in a sortable table
- Display global stats in main window header (and detailed stats in tooltip)
